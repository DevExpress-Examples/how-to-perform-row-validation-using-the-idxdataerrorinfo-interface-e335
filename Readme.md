# How to perform row validation using the IDXDataErrorInfo interface


<p>This example illustrates how to perform row validation using the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraEditors.DXErrorProvider.IDXDataErrorInfo.class">IDXDataErrorInfo interface</a>. When incorrect data is typed within a Grid row, an error icon, indicating to an end-user about this error, appears. Thus, the end-user cannot leave this row until either correct data is entered or changes are canceled.</p>
